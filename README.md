## Overview
This is a memory game built with ReactJS.

## Description of App

* The game is built on a grid made up of images of mario items. If a player has not already clicked on the image, the score increases by one point. After every click, the deck is shuffled. The user clicks on another image. As long as it's a new image, the score keeps increasing. Once the player clicks on an image twice, the score is reset to 0, and the game begins again. Top score is 20.
